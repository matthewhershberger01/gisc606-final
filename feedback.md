What was your favorite part of the class?
  The simple and informative structure and the gooooooood vibes. Both of your classes took the fear of coding out of my sight.
What was your least favorite part of the class?
  Maybe, just maybe it would be interesting to switch to a different work space other than github just to spice things up a bit.
Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
  Alex, you are such a great dude through and through and through. I think students need instructors like you who relate on such a genuine level like you do. Please continue with your beautiful outlook on teaching and sharing your wisdom. You are appreciated, man!!
