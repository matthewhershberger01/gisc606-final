What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
  In my current job, I'm able to utilize GIS in a way that feels very free and not micro-managed. I very much would like to keep up that dynamic while still pushing myself to use different tools to enhance my GIS products for my fellow staff members.
What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?
  Story-telling. Whether thats storymaps or even publishing a book one day that uses maps to tell a story, whether fiction or non-fiction. I think the cartographic aspects of GIS have always been very appealing.
What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
  My song-writing! That, and finding my future wife lol.
